        <h2>About This Site</h2>
        <p>
          In New South Wales, strata-titled apartment buildings are governed by the Strata Schemes Management Act (2015).
          Each building is subdivided into units, or lots, and these are collectively part of the Owners Corporation (also known
          as the body corporate). The corporation is responsible for maintaining common areas, insuring the building, and
          managing administrative and capital works funds funded through owner levies.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Act outlines the roles and responsibilities of the Strata Committee â€” elected representatives of the owners.
          Every committee must include a Chairperson, Secretary, and Treasurer, with up to 9 members in total. This portal
          is designed to assist committee members and residents in the smooth management of the building.

        <h2>Serving on a Strata Committee</h2>
        <p>
          The strata committee is elected at the Annual General Meeting and consists of key roles: Chairperson,
          Secretary, and Treasurer. Additional members may be elected (up to 9 total). Committee members help
          make decisions about common property, finances, and building maintenance.
